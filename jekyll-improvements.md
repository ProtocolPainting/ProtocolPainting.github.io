# Jekyll Theme Improvements

These changes address several issues with the Protocol Painting Jekyll theme.

## Changes Made

### 1. Category System Improvements
- Created a category layout in `_layouts/category.html`
- Added individual category pages in the `category/` directory
- Categories are now fully functional - clicking on a category will display all posts in that category

### 2. Mobile Hero Image Fix
- Added mobile-specific CSS to improve how the hero image displays on smaller screens
- Created a dedicated mobile hero image (hero-mobile.jpg)
- Added an overlay to ensure text remains visible against the background on mobile
- These changes only apply to mobile viewports, preserving the desktop experience

## How to Test

1. **Test Category Functionality:**
   - Go to the Blog page
   - Click on any category in the sidebar
   - Verify that only posts in that category are displayed

2. **Test Mobile Hero Display:**
   - View the site on a mobile device or using browser developer tools in mobile view
   - Check that the hero section text is clearly visible 
   - Verify that the hero background isn't cut off awkwardly

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Categories:**
   - Add new category pages as new blog posts are created
   - Consider implementing automatic category page generation with Jekyll plugins

2. **Image Optimization:**
   - Optimize hero-mobile.jpg specifically for mobile devices (smaller file size, appropriate dimensions)
   - Consider creating additional device-specific images for different screen sizes

3. **Enhanced Mobile Experience:**
   - Review other sections of the site for mobile-specific improvements
   - Consider a more comprehensive mobile-first approach for future updates
