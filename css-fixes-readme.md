# CSS Fixes for Jekyll Theme

This document describes the CSS fixes implemented to resolve layout issues with the Protocol Painting Jekyll theme.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Overlapping sections in About Page**
   - Fixed the "Welcome To Protocol Painting" section where the text box was overlapping with the image
   - Reduced the negative margin from -90px to -50px and added padding

2. **Tag Cloud Functionality**
   - Implemented proper styling for the tag cloud
   - Created individual tag pages for filtering blog posts by tag
   - Updated the tag display on blog posts with clickable links

3. **Responsive Layout Issues**
   - Added media queries to fix spacing on small screens
   - Improved padding and margins in responsive views

## Files Modified

- **Added new CSS file**: `css/custom.css` with fixes
- **Updated layouts**:
  - `_layouts/default.html`: Added custom CSS link
  - `_layouts/post.html`: Improved tag display
  - `blog.html`: Updated tag cloud implementation

## New Files Created

- **Tag Layout**: `_layouts/tag.html` for tag filtering pages
- **Tag Pages**: Created individual tag pages in `/tag/` directory

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Run the Jekyll site locally:
   ```
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. Check the About page to ensure text boxes no longer overlap images
3. Visit the Blog page and test tag functionality by clicking tags

2. Consider automating tag page generation using Jekyll plugins
3. Further optimize responsive design for all screen sizes
