# Project Purpose

This project is a static website for "Protocol Painting", a painting company. The site is built using a purchased HTML template called "PAINTER - Painting Company Website Template" from HTML Codex.

The website appears to be a standard business website with the following key sections:
- Homepage with hero banner
- About section
- Services offered
- Team members
- Testimonials
- Blog/articles
- Contact form

The user intends to convert this HTML template into a Jekyll theme, which would allow for easier content management, templating, and site updates.
