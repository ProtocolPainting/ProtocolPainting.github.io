The current website uses:

1. **HTML5** - Standard HTML structure
2. **CSS3** - Custom styling with responsive design
3. **JavaScript/jQuery** - For interactive elements
4. **Bootstrap 5** - CSS framework for responsive layout and components
5. **Font Awesome** and **Bootstrap Icons** - For iconography
6. **Owl Carousel** - For testimonial slider

The site is currently a static HTML template that needs to be converted to Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator that uses:

- **Ruby** - Programming language Jekyll is built on
- **Liquid** - Templating language
- **Markdown** - For content creation
- **YAML** - For configuration and front matter

The conversion will require setting up Jekyll's directory structure and configuration files, which are not currently present in the project.
